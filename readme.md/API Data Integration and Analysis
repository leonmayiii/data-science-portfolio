# API Data Integration and Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to collect, process, and analyze data retrieved from an external API. The goal is to show proficiency in working with real-world data sources that are commonly used in modern analytics and data science applications.

## Problem Statement
Many real-world datasets are not available as static files and instead must be accessed through APIs. This project explores how to reliably retrieve data from an API, transform it into an analyzable format, and extract meaningful insights.

## Data Description
The data used in this project is retrieved dynamically from an external API. The response data is structured (e.g., JSON) and requires parsing, normalization, and cleaning before analysis.

## Methods and Tools
- Python
- API requests and response handling
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Exploratory data analysis

## Results
The project successfully demonstrates how API-based data can be integrated into a data science workflow. Cleaned and structured data is analyzed to highlight trends and patterns, reinforcing the importance of reliable data ingestion techniques.

## Key Takeaways
- APIs are a critical source of real-world data
- Data preprocessing is essential before analysis
- API integration skills are highly transferable across industries
